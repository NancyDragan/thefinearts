    <p>The band is a program you can join any year. Ryan Foret is an excellent teacher.
      He was able to get his band to finals and competitions each year. He was also able to make a Christmas program for the band. When 
        teaching Mr. Foret can be very strict, but he only wants his band to be one of the best in the state. Before the school year
        starts, there is a summer band camp.</p>
