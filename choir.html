         <p>Sarah Lemons is the teacher of our fine choir groups. Women's Choir, Concert Choir, and JazzCats. She holds concerts once she knows that her choir kids are doing great. The concerts normally occur here at the school in the Little Theater, but places can vary.</p>

      <p>Choir isn't just all singing and dancing, it is also learning how to sing. In each class Mrs. Lemons teaches what notes they should be hitting, songs that would work great for them, and what section they should be in. When being put into sections that determinds what notes, and scales you need to be able to do. </p>
