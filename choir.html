        <p>Sarah Lemons is the teacher of our fine choir groups. Women's Choir, Concert Choir, and JazzCats. 
          She holds concerts once she knows that her choir kids are doing great. 
          The concerts normally occur here at the school in the Little Theater, but places can vary. Choir isn't just singing and 
      dancing, it is also learning how to sing. In each class Mrs. Lemons teaches her kids what notes they should be hitting, songs
      that would work great for them, and what sections they should be in. When being put into sections that determindes what notes
      you should be hitting, and what scales you should be able to do.</div>
