      <p> Ryan Foret also teaches the theater here, too. The theater here at our school is pretty neat. The kids get to write screen plays, help make costumes, build the set, and they can even be stage hands. Now theater class isn't all that easy, but it is fun. You can see how good you are at acting, doing make-up, and buliding stage props.</p>

   <p>With theater it can be very confusing, you have to set up for Spring Show, practice, and still be able to do school work. That may seem hard, but Mr. Foret helps his students put on one great preformance. For every preformance the Little Theater is decorated so nicely, better than it looks year round. If you can't make it to a show, Mr. Foret has back-up plans to make sure that the show can go on.</p>
