         <p>Ryan Foret also teaches the theater here, too.
           The theater here at our school is pretty neat. The kids get to write screen plays, help create costumes, build the set, and they can even be stage hands. 
      Although theater class isn't all that easy, it is very fun and enjoyable. 
      It tests your acting skills, make-up skills, and buliding stage props skills.</p>

     <p> With theater it can be very confusing, you have to
        set up for Spring Show, practice, and still be able to do school work. That may seem hard, but Mr. Foret helps his students put
        on one great preformance. For every preformance the Little Theater is decorated very nicely, better than it looks year round. If 
              you can not make it to a show, Mr. Foret has back-up plans to make sure the show can go on.</p>
