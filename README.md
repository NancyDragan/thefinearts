<p> I went through and set up the basic layout of how the pages of the website were I thought they would be best placed. I then went through and information from the teachers and students from the three classes. We got images that sort of correspond with what we were talking about. I had a little trouble with the images when it came to resizing. They would just come out blurry. With the teachers we talked a little bit about them and how they teach. When it came to finding information, that was tricky. Some of the students I talked with had no clue what I was even asking. Then there was others who were able to give me a time, date, and admission. Over all, it was a fun projet to work with. Maybe I would do this type of thing again some time.</p>
